# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started with react-router

**Thoughts** As I've already been learning React, Redux for the past few weeks, decided to start with 100DaysOfCode. So today, I've started with react-router, went through the documentations, got confused. Watched few videos from Add routing to React apps using React Router v4 course by Joe Maddalone on egghead.io

### Day 2: May 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting with redux

**Thoughts** Finished react-router and practised on dummy project. Decided to include redux for state management, so started watching tutorials by dan abramov on egghead. Will be practising redux for few days.

### Day 3: May 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with redux
**Thoughts** Read some articles on redux for state management. When to use it and how to use it. The concepts felt confusing so will be continuing the redux.
